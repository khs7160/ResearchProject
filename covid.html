            <h2>How covid impacted AI in workforce</h2>
            <p>
                Machines has been replacing jobs over the years as they improved.
                They replaced jobs in history such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spinning jenny replacing weavers</li>
                <li>Buttons replacing elevator operators</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                400,000 jobs were lost to automation in U.S. facatories from 1990 to 2007.
                With covid cases rising, companies started to go to survival  mode to figure how to operate during the pandemic.
                <b>According to statistics, robots could replace 2 million more workers by 2025.</b>
                This had a huge impact on low wage workers and minorities. Many black and Latino Americans are cashiers, food service employees and customer service representations. Which are jobs that are threatened by automation.
                Here are some list of workers replaced recently by automation.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Robots started to clean floors and take people&#39;s temperatures at airports</li>
                <li>Hospitals and universities deployed Sally, a salad making robot made by Chowbotic to replace dining hall employees</li>
                <li>Malls bought knightscope security guard robots</li>
                <li>Industries that made hospitals beds employed Yaskawa America to increase production</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The rise of covid further motivated companies to start using AI in their workforce and even when covid somewhwat goes down in rate, the workers who lost their job are likely not to get hired again.
                With AI and automation taking over small jobs, it is certain that low wage incomes will even have harder time getting hired and keeping their job.
            </p>
