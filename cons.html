            <h2>Cons of AI in workforce</h2>
            <p>
                If you look around yourself right now, you will be able to see plenty of jobs being taken over by automation already. 
                Such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mcdonalds kiosk</li>
                <li>Factory workers (manual labors)</li>
                <li>Receptionists</li>
                <li>Artists losing job</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To elaborate further on artists losing job, there was a Colorado State Fair&#39;s annual art.
                Jason M. Allen&#39;s work was created with an AI program which turned lines of text to hyper realistic graphics which won him the price.
                Mr. Allen was later accused of cheating which Mr. Allen defended that he gave partial credit to the AI in the submission name.
                Tools such as <b>DALL-E 2</b> allows even the amateur artist to create complex art. 
                Because of tools such as <b>DALL-E 2</b> AI created art greatly devalues artworks when you can create art yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are also mental health issues for workers losing jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though robots in factories for example take over strenuous, physically intensive, and risky tasks that helped reduce the worker&#39;s risk, this also raised the pressure on workers with tougher competition for jobs.
                <b>While injuries were reduced 1.2 cases per worker, we saw a significant increase of 37.8 cases per 100,000 people in drug or alcohol related deaths.</b>
                To add to this, workforces working with robots saw a huge increase in suicide rates and mental health issues.
                This was common among males and females aged 45 to 54. The use of autoation decreased the job availability for adults without a college degree, a group with increased mortality in recent years.
